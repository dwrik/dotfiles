# dotfiles

These are the dotfiles and scripts for my [Arch Linux](https://archlinux.org/) rice. Many of the scripts are generic but some are specific to my system. The scripts are located in `~/.local/bin`. It also contains a `statusbar` directory which houses the scripts used for populating my build of [dwmblocks](https://github.com/dwrik/dwmblocks). The rest of the stuff is pretty self explanatory. A detailed list of applications can be found in the `packages` file.
